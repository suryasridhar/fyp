# fyp
A representation of {p,q} tessellation solving the 3-CNF in polynomial time.

Hyperbolic space, represented by trees is given through neighboursUpdate and checked through Game of Life.
In the main binary tree, the states are represented as follows:
#States Key:
# State 0: Dead cells
# State 1: Marking of n in SE/The n-level binary tress of SW quarter/Mark of s-statements/Mark of the 3 variables for each statement if positive/Active s OR value of 0
# State 2: Mark of the 3 variables for each statement if negative/ Active s OR value of 1
